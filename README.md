Chatting App Client
Introduction
This is a PROJECT IVORY repository for a picked up free design from uplabs.com website written in kotlin using MVVM design pattern that containes 5 screens "Login, Signup, forgot password, friend list and chat room" screens. I've implemented each screen and it's functions end to end from scratch server side and client side with CLEAN Archtecture and made it ready to be customized on your project if you wish to use it just clone this project and start customizing.

It's a playground application I've been doing on my spare time to play with jetpack compose, compose material 3 and having a socket connection that allows users to chat and have conversations with each other, also I've written it's backend server side using Ktor server and Kmongo DB as my database.

To have a full cycle working application (celint and server) please clone the chatting-app-server and do what's listed there in the read me file and have fun with it.
